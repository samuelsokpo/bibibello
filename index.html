    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Dark Tones (Slate-900, Slate-800, Rose-300, Stone-300) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is a dashboard centered around an interactive content calendar. A left-hand panel provides filters for content type and content pillars, allowing for thematic exploration. Clicking on any calendar day reveals a modal with the full, detailed content (scripts for Reels/Videos, slide content for Carousels), including visual notes and audio cues. This structure enables users to easily navigate the content plan chronologically and thematically, facilitating content creation and strategic oversight. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: Bibi Bello's 30-day content calendar. Goal: Make content plan easily explorable and actionable for production.
    - Viz/Presentation 1: Interactive Calendar Grid (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Click to view details, hover for subtle highlight. Justification: Intuitive for a schedule-based plan.
    - Viz/Presentation 2: Detail Modal (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Display full content, copy hashtags. Justification: Provides comprehensive details for each piece of content in a focused view.
    - Library/Method: Vanilla JS for dynamic content and interactivity, Tailwind CSS for responsive and thematic styling. Chart.js is omitted as quantitative content analysis is not a primary goal for this specific content strategy dashboard, aligning with the minimalist vibe. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

Bibi sits in a cozy, natural setting (e.g., by a window with soft light, or on a couch with warm throws). Gentle, sincere tone. Focus on inviting the audience into a deeper understanding of active waiting.</p><p><strong>Hook:</strong> "Waiting on God? It's not what you think. It's deeper. It's more active.

Elegant serif font.</p><p><strong>Slide 2: "It's Okay to Be Honest with God."</strong><br>Visual: Simple illustration of hands open, or a single tear. Text: He already knows your heart. Tell Him you're tired, you're numb, you're struggling. Authenticity deepens intimacy, not diminishes it.</p><p><strong>Slide 3: "Prayer Isn't Always About Words."</strong><br>Visual: Image of someone sitting quietly, or looking out. Text: Sometimes, prayer is simply sitting in His presence. It's listening. It's a sigh. It's just 'being' with Him. He understands the language of your spirit.</p><p><strong>Slide 4: "Lean on the Prayers of Others."</strong><br>Visual: Hands clasped in prayer, or a small group. Text: The body of Christ is there for a reason. Ask a trusted friend or family member to pray for you. Their faith can carry you when yours feels weak.</p><p><strong>Slide 5: "Revisit Simple Gratitude."</strong><br>Visual: A single flower, or a warm cup of tea. Text: Even on the hardest days, there's always something to be grateful for. Start there. A simple 'thank you, God' can shift your heart.</p><p><strong>Slide 6: "Consistency Over Intensity."</strong><br>Visual: A gentle, consistent rhythm (e.g., dripping water, soft waves). Text: A short, honest prayer is more powerful than a long, forced one. Show up, even if it's just for five minutes. He values your presence, not your performance.</p><p><strong>Slide 7: "You are not alone in this. Your faith journey is real, and so is His grace.

Text overlay in an elegant serif font.</p><p><strong>Slide 2: "In the quiet moments, His voice is clearest."</strong><br>Visual: Closeup of a journal with a handwritten note: "Be still, and know that I am God." Text: When the world gets loud, intentional stillness becomes our sanctuary. It's where we truly hear Him.</p><p><strong>Slide 3: "Finding peace in the pause."</strong><br>Visual: Soft focus shot of sunlight streaming through a window onto a textured wall. Text: We often rush from one thing to the next, missing the divine appointments in the pauses. Embrace the stillness, for He is there.</p><p><strong>Slide 4: "His presence fills the silence."</strong><br>Visual: A simple, serene landscape (e.g., a misty morning field, or a calm lake). Text: You don't need grand gestures or loud declarations. His presence is in the gentle breeze, the quiet breath, the space between thoughts.</p><p><strong>Slide 5: "What stillness reveals."</strong><br>Visual: A hand gently holding a small, smooth stone. Text: In stillness, we find clarity, peace, and a deeper understanding of His unwavering love. It's where our souls are truly nourished.</p><p><strong>Slide 6: "Seek the stillness.

Elegant serif font.</p><p><strong>Slide 2: "Silence is Not Absence."</strong><br>Visual: Empty chair in a peaceful setting. Text: When God feels silent, it doesn't mean He's absent. Often, it's in the quiet that we learn to truly listen, to discern His subtle movements.</p><p><strong>Slide 3: "Growth Happens in the Waiting."</strong><br>Visual: A seed sprouting. Text: Just like a seed grows in the darkness of the soil, our deepest spiritual growth often occurs in the unseen, silent seasons. Trust the process.</p><p><strong>Slide 4: "Dependence Deepens."</strong><br>Visual: Hands clasped, looking up. Text: When our usual comforts or answers are withheld, we're forced into deeper dependence on Him alone. This builds unwavering faith.</p><p><strong>Slide 5: "New Perspectives Emerge."</strong><br>Visual: A path opening up through mist. Text: Silence can strip away distractions, allowing us to see things from His divine perspective, revealing truths we missed in the noise.</p><p><strong>Slide 6: "His Faithfulness Remains."</strong><br>Visual: A steady, unchanging horizon. Text: Even when you can't hear Him, remember His character. He is faithful. His promises stand firm, regardless of the season.</p><p><strong>Slide 7: "Embrace the quiet.

Elegant serif font.</p><p><strong>Slide 2: "Every sunrise, a new invitation to connect."</strong><br>Visual: Close-up of morning light on a wall. Text: The gentle morning light reminds us of His new mercies. It's a fresh start, a quiet moment to invite Him into your day.</p><p><strong>Slide 3: "Whispers of grace in simple notes."</strong><br>Visual: Close-up of the handwritten prayer card. Text: Sometimes, the deepest prayers aren't spoken aloud, but penned in quiet moments. A simple card, a profound conversation with God.</p><p><strong>Slide 4: "Finding sacred in the everyday."</strong><br>Visual: A serene shot of a simple, cozy corner of a room.

My daily Bible time is non-negotiable. It's my compass, my truth, my constant in a shifting world.</p><p><strong>Slide 3: "Guard Your Heart & Your Circle."</strong><br>Visual: Hands forming a protective gesture, or a small, supportive group. Text: Be intentional about who you let speak into your life. Surround yourself with believers who uplift, challenge, and pray for you. Protect your peace.</p><p><strong>Slide 4: "Remember Your 'Why'."</strong><br>Visual: Bibi singing with passion, or a cross symbol. Text: When the pressures mount, or the comparisons start, I always go back to my 'why': to glorify God through my music, to share His message, to be a vessel. That keeps me grounded.</p><p><strong>Slide 5: "Practice Humility & Service."</strong><br>Visual: Bibi serving others, or a humble posture. Text: It's easy to get caught up in accolades.
